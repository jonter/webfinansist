In this document I am going to separate creating of this project into steps and substeps (probably even subsubsteps) and description of almost each of them.
This plan is not consistent and *can be changed* in advance

*PLAN:*

* I.    Creating a simple budget calculator. All of the incomes and expenses should be added manually.

**DONE** 1. Create a frame of the project (html/css): this step includes also buttons and simple smooth animations (no javascript);

**DONE** 2. Add javascript for our app (using MVC pattern):
    * Add functional for __new item button__: create new list item, calculate bugder and so on
    * Add functional for __remove buttons__

**DONE** 3. Implement persistent data using localStorage

**DONE** 4. Refactor Code a little

**DONE** 5. Add creation time for each list item and display them separatly in groups (each group divided by days):
    



* II.   Refactor code using webpack divide it into modules

* III.  Add new feature: second section for tracking debts (borrowings and lendings)

* IV.   Prepare back-end of the application (MEN stack)

* V.    Mutate app for back-end

* VI.   Upload application
