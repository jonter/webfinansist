In this document I am going to separate creating of this project into steps and substeps (probably even subsubsteps) and description of almost each of them.
This plan is not consistent and *can be changed* in advance

*PLAN:*

* I.    Creating a simple budget calculator. All of the incomes and expenses should be added manually.

1. Create a frame of the project (html/css): this step includes also buttons and simple smooth animations (no javascript);

2. Add javascript for our app (using MVC pattern):
    * Add functional for __new item button__: create new list item, calculate bugder and so on
    * Add functional for __remove buttons__

3. Implement persistent data using localStorage

4. Add creation time for each list element (that should appear only when hover element)

5. Polish UI 

6. Add second representation of data: a single list for all expenses/incomes



* II.   Refactor code using webpack 


* III.  Add new feature: second section for tracking debts (borrowings and lendings)

* IV.   Prepare back-end of the application (MEN stack)

* V.    Mutate app for back-end

* VI.   Upload application
